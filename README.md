# Atmos

Atmos is a simple iOS application developed in SwiftUI that uses the user's current location to retrieve and display real-time weather information, consuming the Open-Meteo API.

The project was designed to demonstrate modern best practices of the iOS ecosystem, such as Swift Concurrency (async/await), state management with SwiftUI, separation of responsibilities, and integration with Core Location.

- Swift Concurrency (async/await)
- CoreLocation – Access to user location
- Open-Meteo API – Weather data source
- Observable (Swift 5.9+) – State management
- MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) – Architecture
